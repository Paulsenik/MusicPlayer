# MusicPlayer

A small MusicPlayer, written in Java, that lets you connect an Arduino to it

!! This Version of the Project will be DISCARDED because of too many BUGS in UI and a BADLY WRITTEN, UNREADABLE and NOT DOCUMENTED Source-Code.

!! As a result a NEW PLAYER with more FEATURES and FIXES will be made from scratch.

!! Planned FEATURES and FIXES =>
- Equalizer
- SoundBoard (built in)
- Memory-Optimization
- Improved and new UI-Engine (https://github.com/realPaulsen/Java-Project-Library)

!! Note: The software still works as intended (if the user does not mind the minor bugs in UI)
